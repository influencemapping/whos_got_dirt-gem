        fund managers in the United States took home a total of $21.15 billion in
        compensation in 2013, according to an annual ranking published on Tuesday
        by Institutional Investor&#226;&#128;&#153;s Alpha magazine.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They
        earned that hefty sum in a year when most hedge fund managers fell short of
        the market&#226;&#128;&#153;s returns. The multibillion-dollar payday is the
        highest since 2010, and it is 50 percent more than in 2012, according to the

        top 25 hedge fund managers reaped $11.62 billion in compensation in 2014,
        according to an annual ranking by Institutional Investor&#226;&#128;&#153;s
        Alpha magazine.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Griffin started by trading convertible
        bonds out of his dormitory at Harvard. His firm, Citadel, posted returns of
        18 percent to investors in its flagship Kensington and Wellington funds.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At
        Renaissance, the best performing equities fund was up 14.5 percent and its
        institutional futures fund gained 7.4 percent. Mr. Simons' wealth, however,
        is tied up in the firm&#226;&#128;&#153;s secretive Medallion fund, which
        manages only employees&#226;&#128;&#153; money and has earned average annual
        returns of more than 30 percent over two decades.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Dalio
        runs the world&#226;&#128;&#153;s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates,
        with more than $170 billion in assets under management. Bridgewater started
        the year strong, with well-placed bets on interest rates in Europe and the
        United States, but momentum slowed in the second half of the year. He made
        3.6 percent and 8.7 percent in his two main Pure Alpha funds.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr.
        Ackman is known for making large and concentrated bets, and for being outspoken
        about them. His Pershing Square Capital funds gained 36 percent and 40 percent,
        the best returns in the 2014 ranking.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Englander's firm,
        Millennium, made returns of 12 percent in 2014. Based in New York, Millennium
        uses a platform model to invest with 170 individual managers who each use
        their own trading strategies. Mr. Englander does not charge a management fee.
        Instead, investors share the costs of running the firm. </description><is_ranked>1</is_ranked><updated_at>2015-05-05
